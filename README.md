# Password-Generator
this is a simple password generator with simple javaScript codes

# About this project

 A password is randomly generated based on criteria that the user provides when prompted.

When the user clicks the button "Generate Password" they are first promoted for password length. If user enter outside the range of 8-120, the user is prompted to try again to enter a password length within the range. The prompt will keep going until the user enters the desired number.

The program then prompts the user to define if they would like to include numbers, characters, uppercase and/or lowercase letters. If the user selects none to all criteria, the program will ask it to select at least each one and will loop back through the prompts.

When all parameters have been defined, the password will appear within the password box.

Technologies Used: HTML5, CSS and JavaScript
